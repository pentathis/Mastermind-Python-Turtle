# Mastermind-Python-Turtle

This is a game of Mastermind built in Python using the Turtle module. 
## Rules
The computer randomly decides a code, an ordered seqeunce of four colours. 
Your aim to is identify the seqeunce correctly. You click on one colour in the right panel to pick it, and click on a circle to fill it. 
When you click ENTER, the computer gives you your results in the four small circles. The order of the coloured small circles has no significance.
The number of red small circles is the number of colours in your answer, which are present in the code at the correct position. 
The number white small circles is the number of colours in your answer, which are present in the code, but at a position different than what you have set them at.
The number of blank small circles is the number of colours in your answer that are absent in the code.
When you choose an answer, you must fill all the circles and with distinct colours.
You get ten chances to guess the code correctly.
Best of Luck!
